# `oop` - The Bane of Rust
`oop` is not your elder matriarch's package. `oop` is a **work in progress use-at-your-own-risk** package that adds rudimentary Object-Oriented "inheritence." Please do not use this package for any serious projects. This was mainly made as a joke I came up with at midnight while I was talking with my friend on VC.
